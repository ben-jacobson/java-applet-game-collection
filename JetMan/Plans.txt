JetMan proposal/plans

arcade style game where the player must use his jetpack and jumping skills to avoid aliens and collect
parts to fix his space ship. The player will go through levels of spaceship internal, external, alien
landscape and into an alien colony. each level has a series of parts with one unique part each level.
each level will be puzzling and entertaining

story:
jetman is flying around space trying to get home. he is shot down by a bunch of gangros on 
a planet. he crashes and loses all his parts. he must find all the parts, avoid enemies and repair his 
ship to head back to earth.

the player:
jetman. has a jetpack and anti-grav boots. can jump two squares up.

the enemies: 
1. Arachno: an alien that looks like a spider with claws. try to avoid this one, he will poison you.
2. WingHerd: an alien bird looking thing. flys around. taken down in 2 shots.
3. Phillis: 2 legged beast, will eat you. taken down in two shots.
4. Gangro: weird looking turret thing. stays still and shoots plasma at you.
5. Cyba: the ultimate and hard to fight enemy. takes 10 laser shots to kill. lucky these are rare.
   these will shoot you when they see you.

items:
1. part. different parts that have to be collected. randomized each time. In each level there will be a
   unique and important part to collect. there will be 5 randomized parts and 5 unique parts.
2. fuel. for the jetpack if there is no more fuel. the player cannot fly
3. extra life.
4. laser gun. for shooting aliens.

levels:
1. inside space ship.
2. outside space ship.
3. alien landscape.
4. alien colony.
5. final alien colony.

notes:
*each level will be differentiated by its level background and tileset.
*each level will have a different amount of parts, depending how hard the level is.
*when the player finishes. he jumps up and down then the level is complete.
*the applet will be 500x500
*squares will be 25x25. leaving level size to be 20x20 arrays (preferably text files)
*There will be ladders, floor and walls.

creation:

classes.
player : handles player x,y. hasGun, fuel level, drawing, xspeed, yspeed, collision detection with blocks + enemies, 
         handle function. handles animation of graphic.
enemy : base class for enemies. x, y pos, hp, graphics, drawing, handle function. handles animation 
        of graphic. behavoural type. (flying, turret, moving, shooting. ect)
gui : hold graphics + game states. draws them + holds variables for tx,ty ect of playing field.
score : holds score level, lives left, items gotten, draws these.
level : holds the layout for the current level, the handle function (main handle function), drawing function,
        map array. 
levels : class for holding the map layouts for all 5 maps. holds waypoint arrays for all maps + enemy array
waypoint : basic waypoint class, with an x, y and id number.
item : base class for all items that can be acquired. its graphics, type of item, x, y pos

tests to be run before dev:
*inheritance/
*animated gifs + controlling and animating gifs. /
*study keyUp method see what it does. /

design cycle:
planning /
graphics (placeholders) /
programming /
testing /
graphics (final) /
further bug testing. (changed collision) /
shipping

to be finished by 29/9/04 + 1 week (second holiday week) for graphics + level design. due term 4 start
*finished 26/9/04 (3 days before scheduler + didnt use extra week) hooray!
