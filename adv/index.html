                This is a java applet adventure game engine, so far incomplete, <br>
                Things i need to add: <br><br>
                * reset inv places needs fixing, it seems to create error when last item is taken <br>
                * Settings Screen with game Speeds + score Counter + reset button + credits<br>
                * Event Handler functions:  item in bounds (obj and screen) <br>
                * Event handler mutidimensional array instead of singular. allows simultaneous and scripted events.<br>
                * Player needs to be customizable (x, y, width, height, starting direction, walking speed), player collision box<br>
                * Multiple Player Images, give them 8 different ones.<br>
                * Allow customizable inventory + static item collision boxes<br>
                * Optimize functions for speed + clean up unused variables (static and non-static)<br>
