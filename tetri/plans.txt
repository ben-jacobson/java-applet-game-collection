plans for tetri

game of tetris. sized 400(w)x500(h) sized applet

classes:

GUI : handles gui, main positions of gui, responsible for drawing the main screen, showing score, showing level
score : responsible for score, level number. calculates how fast a block will move with the level number.
blockMatrix : responsible for keeping data on which blocks are on the screen, keeping the graphics for the blocks in data,
	drawing the blocks on the screen, will also have functions for retrieving block rotation peice, functions for 
	collision  detection, will handle victory, block lines and loss conditions, handles nextBlock, randomizing + drawing. 
block : keeps the block combinations in small arrays. blockMatrix will have his own copy of this class inside as a variable
	contains the 4 different combinations of blocks with their respective rotated piece.

notes:

:the level number will only determine the speed of how fast the blocks will fall. 5 will be enough, after that you have won.
:the block array in class:blockMatrix will be numbered 0 (none/blank) and 1-4 (4 different colours of blocks) and 
 4-8 (same colour) but not moving. so; 0 = none, 1-4 = colour moving, 5-9 = colour not moving. when blocks have stopped moving
 add 4 to the combination array in the blockMatrix. 
:block combinations will be small array containing the shape of the peice.
:colours of blocks will be randomized everytime new blocks enter the screen.
:a line will give you 100 points
:victory (one level) will be 5000 points (thats 50 lines broken)
:speed is calculate: s=m-l/4. s=speed, m=max levels, l=current level. example speed = 5-1 / 4 = 1 second to wait, 5-3/4 = 0.5 seconds to wait

to be finished by 27/8/04 (2 week project)

left to do (15/8/04): (* = done)
	multiple pieces (not just one) *
	fall piece functions. *
	a rotate function *
	nextBlock. *
	won + lost screens.* // the last thing to do. this is considered polish

testing needs doing with the new rotate peice function*

finished 16/8/04 (11 days early)
